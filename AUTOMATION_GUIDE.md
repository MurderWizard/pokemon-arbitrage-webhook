# Hands-Off Automation Guide

## Overview

This guide explains how to set up and operate the Pokemon Card Arbitrage system in full hands-off mode. The system implements advanced automation strategies discovered from trading communities to maximize profit while minimizing human intervention.

## ü§ñ What "Hands-Off" Means

- **Automatic Deal Discovery**: Scans multiple platforms 24/7 for opportunities
- **Smart Auto-Buy**: Automatically purchases qualifying deals based on your criteria
- **Dynamic Repricing**: Adjusts prices based on market conditions and inventory age
- **Intelligent Notifications**: Only alerts you for high-priority items or issues
- **Risk Management**: Built-in controls to prevent runaway spending or bad decisions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Basic Setup
```bash
# Clone and enter directory
cd pokemon

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your API keys and preferences
nano .env
```

### 2. Essential Configuration

**Telegram Bot** (‚úÖ COMPLETED):
```bash
TG_TOKEN=7688729602:AAEoi5jAtR-n3XOxJI7DSonbLoqJSEXaXvA
TG_ADMIN_ID=7507609139
```

**eBay API** (‚è≥ PENDING APPROVAL):
```bash
EBAY_APP_ID=your_app_id_here
EBAY_ENVIRONMENT=production
```

**Status**: ‚úÖ Developer account submitted, waiting for approval (24-48 hours)

**When Approved**:
1. Check email for approval notification
2. Go to https://developer.ebay.com/my/keys  
3. Copy your App ID to the .env file
4. Test: `python3 ebay_sdk_integration.py`
5. Start: `python3 real_deal_finder.py`

**Auto-Buy Settings** (Start conservative):
```bash
AUTO_BUY_ENABLED=false          # Start with false, enable after testing
MAX_AUTO_BUY_AMOUNT=200.0       # Max per item
DAILY_AUTO_BUY_LIMIT=500.0      # Max per day
MIN_AUTO_BUY_MARGIN=0.35        # 35% minimum profit margin
AUTO_BUY_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.8 # 80% confidence required
```

### 3. Price Database Management

**Current Status**: ‚úÖ 14 cards loaded, system ready

**Weekly Price Updates** (Critical for accuracy):
```bash
# Interactive update session (Sundays, 30 min)
python3 weekly_price_updater.py

# Quick price check
python3 price_manager.py --search "Charizard VMAX"

# Add new trending card
python3 price_manager.py --add "New Card" "Set Name" 75.00 "Near Mint"
```

**Update Frequency Strategy**:
