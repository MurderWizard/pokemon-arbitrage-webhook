## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### **Enhanced Daily Updater Features**

#### **Smart Mode Detection**
```python
# Automatically chooses optimal strategy
if total_cards < 1000:
    mode = 'EXPANSION'  # Add lots of cards
elif freshness < 85%:
    mode = 'REFRESH'    # Update existing
else:
    mode = 'MAINTENANCE' # Strategic additions
```

#### **Browse API Trend Scanning**
```python
# Discovers trending cards in real-time
search_terms = [
    "Pokemon V alt art",
    "Pokemon VMAX rainbow", 
    "Pokemon ex full art",
    "Japanese promo exclusive"
]

# Finds new cards worth $25+ automatically
# Adds to database with market-derived pricing
```

#### **Market Intelligence**
```python
# Real market data from Browse API
{
    'market_price': 85.50,
    'listing_count': 47,
    'price_range': '$75.00 - $95.00',
    'trend': 'rising',
    'freshness_hours': 2
}
```

### **Advanced Repricing Engine Features**

#### **Smart Pricing Logic**
```python
# Graded cards: Premium pricing
if grade >= 9:
    target_price = market_price * 1.05  # 5% premium

# Raw cards: Competitive pricing  
else:
    target_price = market_price * 0.98  # 2% below market

# Aging discounts
if days_listed > 30:
    target_price *= 0.95  # 5% discount
```

#### **Profit Protection**
```python
# Never sell below minimum margin
min_price = purchase_price * 1.20  # 20% markup minimum
final_price = max(target_price, min_price)
```

#### **Automation Levels**
```python
# Auto-apply small changes (< 5%)
if abs(price_change_percent) <= 5.0 and confidence == 'HIGH':
    auto_apply_repricing()
else:
    queue_for_manual_review()
```
