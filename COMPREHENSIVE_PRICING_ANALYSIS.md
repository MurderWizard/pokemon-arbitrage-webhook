## ⏰ DAILY PRICE UPDATE STRATEGY

3. **New Releases**: Cards from latest sets
4. **Tournament Winners**: Cards gaining popularity

#### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Weekly - 45 min)

## 💰 FUTURE REPRICING STRATEGY

### **When to Implement**
- **Phase 1**: After first successful purchase & grading (2-3 months)
- **Phase 2**: When you have 5+ cards listed for sale
- **Phase 3**: Full automation with 20+ active listings

### **Repricing System Architecture**

#### **Core Components Needed**
1. **Inventory Tracking**: What you own & purchase prices
2. **Daily Price Monitoring**: Market price changes for your cards
3. **Profit Margin Protection**: Minimum markup rules
4. **Platform Integration**: eBay listing management
5. **Manual Approval**: Safety checks before price changes

#### **Repricing Logic**
```python
# Smart repricing algorithm
def calculate_optimal_sell_price(card, purchase_price, current_market):
    # Base pricing rules
    if card.type == "raw":
        target_price = current_market * 0.98  # 2% below market
    elif card.type == "graded":
        if card.grade >= 9:
            target_price = current_market * 1.05  # 5% premium for high grades
        else:
            target_price = current_market * 0.95  # 5% below for lower grades
    
    # Aging discounts
    if days_listed > 30:
        target_price *= 0.95  # 5% discount after 30 days
    if days_listed > 60:
        target_price *= 0.90  # 10% discount after 60 days
    
    # Profit protection
    min_price = purchase_price * 1.20  # 20% minimum markup
    
    return max(target_price, min_price)
```

#### **Automation Levels**
1. **Manual**: Daily reports, manual price updates
2. **Semi-Auto**: Suggested prices, click to approve
3. **Full Auto**: Automatic updates within safety rules

#### **Integration Points**
- **eBay Listing Management**: Update listing prices
- **Inventory Database**: Track purchase/sale history
- **Market Data**: Daily price feeds from Browse API
- **Notification System**: Alert on major price changes
