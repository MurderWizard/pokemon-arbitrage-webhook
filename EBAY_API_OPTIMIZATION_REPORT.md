### Rate Limiting Best Practices
```python
# Implement intelligent cooldown
time.sleep(12)  # 5 calls/minute maximum

# Use maximum items per request
pagination = {'entriesPerPage': 50, 'pageNumber': 1}

# Cache results aggressively
cache_duration = 15  # minutes
```

## 📊 Market Coverage Analysis

### Daily Coverage Statistics
- **Target Cards**: 6 high-ROI cards

## 🛡️ Risk Mitigation & Safety

### API Limit Protection
- **Conservative usage**: 5.8% of daily limit
- **Real-time monitoring**: Track usage throughout day
- **Automatic throttling**: Reduce frequency if approaching limits
- **Graceful degradation**: Extend intervals rather than fail

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# Exponential backoff for rate limits
for attempt in range(3):
    try:
        result = api_call()
        break
    except RateLimitError:
        wait_time = 2 ** attempt * 30  # 30s, 60s, 120s
        time.sleep(wait_time)
```

### Usage Monitoring
- **Real-time tracking**: Calls made vs. limits
- **Daily reports**: Usage patterns and efficiency
- **Alert system**: Warn when approaching 80% of limits
- **Automatic adjustment**: Reduce frequency dynamically
