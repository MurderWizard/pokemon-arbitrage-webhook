When creating your application, use these details:

**Application Name**: Pokemon Card Arbitrage System
**Application Description**: 
```
Automated system for monitoring Pokemon card prices on eBay to identify arbitrage opportunities. 
The system compares eBay listing prices with market values to find undervalued cards for resale.
```

**Primary Use Case**: Price monitoring and comparison
**Secondary Use Case**: Market research and analytics
**Expected Daily API Calls**: 1,000-10,000 (depending on scanning frequency)

## üîê API Limits and Best Practices

### Rate Limits
- **Production**: 5,000 calls per day (free tier)
- **Sandbox**: 1,000 calls per day
- **Paid tiers**: Up to 100,000+ calls per day

### Best Practices
- Cache results to reduce API calls
- Use specific search terms to get relevant results
- Implement retry logic for failed requests
- Monitor your usage to avoid hitting limits

## üõ†Ô∏è Alternative: Web Scraping (No API Required)

If you prefer not to wait for API approval, the system can use web scraping:

### Pros:
- No API registration required
- No rate limits
- Free to use
- Works immediately

### Cons:
- Slower than API calls
- More likely to be blocked
- Less reliable
- Against eBay's Terms of Service

### Enable Web Scraping:
In your .env file:
```bash
EBAY_USE_SCRAPING=true
EBAY_APP_ID=  # Leave blank for scraping mode
```

## üöÄ Quick Start (Scraping Mode)

If you want to start immediately without waiting for API approval:

1. **Enable scraping mode**: Edit .env and set `EBAY_USE_SCRAPING=true`
2. **Test the system**: Run `python3 real_deal_finder.py`
3. **Monitor results**: Check Telegram for deal alerts
4. **Upgrade later**: Add API keys when you get them

## üí° Recommendations

**For Testing**: Start with scraping mode
**For Production**: Get API access for reliability
**For High Volume**: Consider paid API tier

The system is designed to work with both methods and will automatically switch based on your configuration.
